        <h1>JMRI: The Cornwall RR Panel</h1>

        <p>JMRI was used to create the <a href="SamplePanel.shtml">dispatcher control panel</a> for Nick Kulp's
        Cornwall RR. <a href="Cornwall.shtml">Another page</a>
        briefly describes how it was done.
        This page includes additional detail on some topics.</p>

        <a id="open"><h2>Opening a panel at program startup</h2></a>
        <p>The CornwallRR program was modified to automatically open the dispatcher
        panel at startup.  This was an OK solution because that was a custom
        program anyway.  But it's also possible to edit the Preferences so
        that a panel is automatically opened.</p>
