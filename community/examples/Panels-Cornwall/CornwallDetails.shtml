        JMRI was used to create the <a href="SamplePanel.shtml">dispatcher control panel</a> for Nick Kulp's
Cornwall RR. <a href="Cornwall.shtml">Another page</a>
briefly describes how it was done.  
This page includes additional detail on some topics.

<a id="open"><h2>Opening a panel at program startup</h2></a>
The CornwallRR program was modified to automatically open the dispatcher
panel at startup.  This was an OK solution because that was a custom
program anyway.  But it's also possible to edit the Preferences so
that a panel is automatically opened.
