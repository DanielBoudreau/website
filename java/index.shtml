<h1>Using Java 11 with JMRI</h1>

We recommend using Java 11 with current JMRI versions.
JMRI needs a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE),
but will work fine with the larger "Java Development Kit" (JDK).

<p>Before getting a new version of Java, it is useful to check what version is currently installed 
on your computer.  On Windows, for example, open a "command" window by typing "Command prompt" into the search bar
 next to the Windows Start icon.  Then type:</p>
     
     <pre>java -version</pre>
     
<p>IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU REMOVE OLD VERSIONS OF JAVA BEFORE YOU UPGRADE. This avoids a number of reported
problems.  On Windows, for example, you can:

     <ul>
        <li>Go to Windows <strong>Settings&rArr;Apps</strong>, find Java 8 and click on <strong>"Uninstall."</strong></li>
        <li>Alternatively, download the <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/uninstalltool.jsp
        " target="_blank">Oracle Java Uninstall tool</a> and follow its instructions</li>
     </ul>
     
<p>See the <a href="../help/en/html/setup/">JMRI Setup and Install pages</a> for more information.</p>     
     
<h1>Getting Java 11</h1>

Here are some places you can get Java 11.  Click on the links to
go to the download page.


<ol>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&package=jre">Azul</a>
        - Go to the bottom of the page, past the advertising, select
        your OS type (Windows, macOS, Linux), then if needed the computer CPU
        architecture (we recommend 64-bit if you have a 64-bit computer), then pick the
        appropriate download from the page.
        
        <p>Windows users should pick the ".msi" installer, as it properly
        sets up various registry values.

    <li>
        <a href="https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=406&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=401">OpenLogic</a>
         -
        Select your OS type (Windows, macOS, Linux).  OpenLogic only has a 64-bit version so make sure
        you have a 64-bit computer.  Pick a download from the page.
        <p>
        On Windows: when you run the Java installer, be sure to select the "JavaSoft (Oracle) registry keys" option.
    <li>
        <a href="https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11">Adoptium (Eclipse)</a>
        - This website refers to a Java JDK as "Temurin", which is a bit confusing.
        Make sure that "Temurin 11" is selected, then press the large "Latest Release" button.
        <p>
        On Windows: when you run the Java installer, be sure to select the "JavaSoft (Oracle) registry keys" option.

    <li>
        <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html">Oracle</a>
        -
        The original JDK source, but this page requires you to set up a (free) Oracle account. No JREs available.
        <p>We recommend that Windows users pick the "Windows x64 Installer", as it properly sets up various registry values.

    <li>
        <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads/">IBM</a>
        - They provide JDKs under the "Semeru" name.
