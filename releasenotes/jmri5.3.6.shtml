      Release Notes for JMRI 5.3.6 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MM DDD, 2023</p>
    <p>From: release pumpkin</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.3.6 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.3.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.4 production release in June 2023.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.2.shtml">JMRI 5.3.2</a></span>
        Some images in the <i>resources/icons</i> folder have been renamed.
        Spaces have been changed to underscore. It's images in the <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/ACEI</i>,
        <i>resources\icons\ItalianSignals\Prototypical</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NW-1981</i>, <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NYC-1956</i>,

     <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.1.7.shtml">JMRI 5.1.7</a></span>
        The way defaults for some LocoNet connections are handled has changed.
        Existing LocoNet connections might give a "The Defaults preferences are invalid"
        warning when saving preferences.  In that case, click "yes" and then go set
        all the default radio buttons on the "Defaults" pane to the LocoNet connection.  (You can also
        click "no", but you'll get the message next time you store too)

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
