      Release Notes for JMRI 5.4 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MMM DD< 2023></p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Production Release 5.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 5.3 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 5.4" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

        The way defaults for some LocoNet connections are handled has changed.
        Existing LocoNet connections might give a "The Defaults preferences are invalid"
        warning when saving preferences.  In that case, click "yes" and then go set
        all the default radio buttons on the "Defaults" pane to the LocoNet connection.  (You can also
        click "no", but you'll get the message next time you store too)

in those is
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-12-06..2023-06-20">available from our code repository</a>.


<!-- ======== Merged Changes  ================================================== -->

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/hubpane/CbusHubPane.shtml"
                >CBUS Hub Control</a> can be used to share the CBUS connection locally and onto a LAN.</li>
                <li>Changed SPROG DCC module IDs to match similar MERG modules,
                to work around an issue with the FCU tool.</li>
                <li>Improved Node Manager configuratiuon of MERG CANSERVO8C / CANMIO-SVO / CANACC4</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve handling of poll options for network connections.</li>
                <li>Remove extraneous ERROR message when network connections.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>DCC++ and DCC-EX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New script in DCC-EX folder, RosterExportToDCC-EX.py, which outputs all JMRI roster entries in
                format suitable for copying into myAutomation.h.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Lenz XPressNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clarify some internal implementation terminology.</li>
                <li>Add support for up to Fn68 when the Lenz hardware is version 4.0 or later.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New LocoNetSlotsReadCSV.py script which scans all LocoNet slots and
                    creates report about slot status and slots used for the consists
                    including the details of the consist. It also flags all non-zero slots. </li>
                <li>Add Consist number column.</li>
                <li>Support for expanded slots and associated protocol.
                    To enable this the advanced LocoNet preferences must be set XPSlots Auto Detect.
                    If using DCS240(+) limited to less than 120 slots use DCS210 or DCS210+ to avoid needless reading of slots.
                    When using a DCS240(+) be aware that when first opening a Slot Monitor window 430 odd slots are read, so avoid doing it during layout start.
                    If using throttles that cannot access XP Slots along side those that can you may see the same loco number twice in the slotmon, which slot actually has control may vary.
                </li>
                <li>Changed handling of LACK messages during programming to
                    avoid a recently-uncovered conflict with attached DT602D
                    throttles.</li>
                <li>Added a new jython/loconet directory to contain new LocoNet-specific scripts.<li>
                <li>Added a jython/loconet/LoconetOpsModeSim.py that works with LocoNet simulator
                    to simulate ops-mode writes and reads.</li>
                <li>Added support for the programming protocol used by
                    Digitrax Series 7 boards (DS74, SE74, etc)</li>
                <li>Simplified the display of LocoNet sensor messages in the monitor</li>
                <li>Fixed a problem introduced in JMRI 5.3.3 that caused
                    certain ops-mode programming operations to fail.</li>
                <li>LocoNet connections now support decoder functions up to F68</li>
                <li>Improved handling of BXP88 messages</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Marklin CS2</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New connection subtype for the CdB system via USB.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A Reporter implementation is now available for MQTT connections.</li>
                <li>Fix typo in Sensor default name; should not have visible effect.</li>
                <li>Added support for variable Lights.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Programmer support added. Enables using DecoderPro on the
                    TCS CS-105 and LT-50 command stations. Service Mode
                    (Programming Track, with Direct Mode) and Ops Mode (Programming
                    on Main) are both supported. RailCom-aware decoders can read
                    CVs on the main (in Ops Mode), which is a lot faster than
                    reading on the Programming Track.</li>
                <li>Updated library to pick up fix to line-ends in hub.</li>
                <li>Hub Control - UI Update, line termination characters optional for incoming feeds.</li>
                <li>When downloading firmware to multiple boards, it can be a pain to have to select the file over and over.
                    This was changed to make the selected file (hence directory, etc) persistent from one download frame
                    to the next.
                <li>Show more information in the node selector when doing firmware downloads.</li>
                <li>Updated the default filename when doing backups to contain more identification info.</li>
                <li>The OpenLCB library was updated to the current contents as of PR #214</li>
                <li>There's a new
                    "<a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/eventtable/EventTablePane.shtml">Event Table</a>"
                    tool that shows all the events on the network and which nodes produce and consume them.</li>
                <li>There's a new
                    "<a href="https://help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/memtool/MemoryToolPane.shtml">Memory Tool</a>"
                    that lets you get the contents of node memory spaces into a local binary file, and
                    put the contents of a file back into a node memory space.</li>
                <li>Now shows more about JMRI nodes in the Configure Nodes window.
                <li>Updated the openlcb.jar library to version

    <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Fix allocating over occupied blocks in IntermediateSections</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
	        <li>Fixes a bug in the actions <i>Icon/Label on panel</i> and
	        <i>Turnout on LayoutPanel</i> which caused that the actions
	        wasn't loaded correctly.</li>
	        <li>Add support for LogixNG Global Variable icons.  These work like memory icons.</li>
          <li>Tooltips have been enabled for turnouts and slips on Layout Editor panels. The tooltip
          displays the name of the assigned turnout. The format is <strong>system</strong> or
          <strong>user (system)</strong>. For slips, both turnout names are displayed.  If a turnout
          has not been assigned to a turnout or slip, the internal TOnn or SLnn id will be displayed.
          The tooltips are shown based on the <strong>Options &rArr; Show Icon tooltips </strong>
          settings used by the regular icon tooltips.  Custom tooltips are not available.</li>
	      <li>Add a scale item to popup menu.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Logix</h3>
        <a id="Logix" name="Logix"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognize Logix user name changes for Conditional Logix Actions.  This is an action
          that can be used to enable or disable a different Logix.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The action <i>Turnout on LayoutPanel</i> has been added.
          It lets LogixNG enable/disable a turnout on a layout panel.</li>
          <li>The action <i>RunOnce</i> has been added. It runs an action
          only one time. It's useful when something needs to be initialized
          once.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug when importing a Logix with <i>Copy memory</i> to
          LogixNG. The source memory and the destination memory was reversed.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug when importing a Logix to LogixNG, where the Conditional
          uses <i>Mixed</i>. The <i>Not</i> is ignored for the conditional
          variables when using Mixed.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug with the action Entry/Exit and the expression Entry/Exit.
          The action and expression stored the user name instead of the system name
          if the Entry/Exit. The user name of an Entry/Exit changes when the NX sensor
          or related signal mast is changed.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug with the action Timer. If the same sensor is used for both
          start and stop of the timer, the timer didn't restarted after a stop.</li>
          <li>The action Timer can now use the expression <i>Start</i> to both start
          and stop the timer. This is useful if you want to start and stop the timer
          from a single sensor.</li>
          <li>Adds panel file XSLT formatting for display of Digital Actions,
          Expressions, and Boolean Actions in web browser.</li>
          <li>Pressing the F8 key when the spash screen is visible disables all the LogixNGs.</li>
          <li>Pressing the F9 key when the spash screen is visible prevents LogixNG being activated.</li>
          <li>A bug that prevented the <i>Shut down task</i> action to work correctly has been fixed.</li>
          <li>The expression <i>Linux Line Power</i> has been added.</li>
          <li>Cleanup LogixNG controlled Dispatcher train when the train has been terminated by an external action.</li>
          <li>Add a <strong>Section Expression</strong> which is used to get the state of a section.
          The state can be <strong>Free</strong>, <strong>Forward</strong> or <strong>Reverse</strong>.</li>
          <li>Add a <strong>Transit Expression</strong> which is used to get the state of a transit.
          The state can be <strong>Idle</strong> or <strong>Assigned</strong>.</li>
          <li>Apply the <strong>Clock Expression</strong> settings when creating a new expression.</li>
          <li>Enable the <strong>Light Action</strong> data input fields when <strong>Set Intensity
          </strong> or <strong>Set Transition Time</strong> is selected.</li>
          <li>Add the <strong>Web request</strong> action that sends a HTTP or HTTPS request to a web server.</li>
        </ul>

         <ul>
             <li>Fixed a problem when a location has multiple spurs and the spur's schedule
             forwards the car to another spur
             at the same location with a schedule.
             The car's load can incorrectly change to the default "E" or "L" load.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem when a location has multiple spurs and the spur's schedule forwards the car to another spur

        <ul>
            <li>Add support for LogixNG Global Variable icons.  These work like memory icons.</li>
           <li>The show hidden items selection was not being stored properly.  The fix may cause
            unexpected changes the first time a PE panel is loaded.</li>
         </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>

        </ul>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a <strong>File Chooser Dialog file view</strong> option to the <strong>Display
            </strong> preference.  This provides the ability to choose a <strong>List</strong> or
            <strong>Detail</strong> view for file dialogs.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>

            <li>Add a PanelControlsContents.py script which lets you
                set a panel to controlling the layout or not.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>
        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The BNSF-1996 and CCOR-1967 signal systems have had some corrections
                    made to their speed settings to make them more consistent with
                    the underlying indications.</li>
                <li>The XML Schema for signal systems has been updated to require
                    there be one and only one speed and speed2 setting.</li>
                <li>Pino Di Biasi provided an Italian signal system</li>
                <li>Spaces are no longer allowed in image file names for signal systems.
                    Use underscore instead of space. For example <i>ACEI_Acc_1_vela_giallo.gif</i>
                    instead of <i>ACEI Acc 1 vela giallo.gif</i></li>
                <li>Pino Di Biasi updated the Italian signal system</li>
                <li>Robert Raggi provided the new Reading 1954 signal system.</li>
                <li>Updated AAR-1946 aspect mappings.</li>
                <li>Updated the appearances in the Reading-1954 system.</li>
                <li>Updated several definitions to replace invalid <i>speed</i> and
                    <i>speed2</i> values with proper speed indications.
                    The invalid values had been previously interpreted as zero.</li>
                <li>Updated the <i>xml/schema/aspecttable.xsd</i> schema to ensure that
                    only valid <i>speed</i> and <i>speed2</i> values will occur in
                    signal system definitions.</li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Switchboard Editor</h3>
        <a id="SW" name="SW"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Change the way user names are displayed in the cell contents. This
                allows word breaks onto additional lines in the display.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a feature to allow custom markers on speed sliders, see <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/throttle/RostersMediaPane.shtml"> documention on Roster Media Pane page</a> (Custom attributes section)</li>
            <li>Small bugs fixes :  previous and next running throttle buttons were reversed, large horizontal speed slider thumb was resized, large speed slider track computation was buggy</li>
            <li> Throttle related Jynstruments code was refactored to use non deprecated Function methods</li>
            <li>Some minor internal cleanup.</li>
            <li>If you select a roster entry, the throttle displays functions up to the
                least of the number of functions available
                from the layout connection, or the maximum function in the decoder
                definition.
                For most decoders, this will be 28,
                but there are a few definitions that are larger or smaller.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Timetable</h3>
        <a id="Timetable" name="Timetable"></a>

            <li>The shutdown process is now run in a separate thread and not on the GUI/Layout thread.</li>
            <li>Updated the plantuml library to version 1.2023.1.  This is used to
                create program documentation.</li>
            <li>When downloading firmware to multiple boards, it can be a pain to have to select the file over and over.
                This was changed to make the selected file (hence directory, etc) persistent from one download frame
                to the next.
            <li>The NamedIcon class will now search <i>Locations.ALL</i> for files. This means
                <ul>
                <li>Files and filepaths will be found in the user area first for all
                    subclasses of
                    <a href="https://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/catalog/NamedIcon.html">NamedIcon</a>.
                <li>This change might result in different graphics in some cases,
                    where it hadn't been
                    searching before and a file was not being found (even though it
                    really should have been). Please check your graphics carefully to
                    see if there are any issues.
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add clickable table of contents to Panel File display/print capability
                (when you open a panel xml file via the JMRI web server)</li>
            <li>New
                <a href="https://jmri.org/jython/anyrail/AnyRailBuildBlockSensorList.py">AnyRailBuildBlockSensorList.py</a>
                script and associated
                <a href="https://jmri.org/jython/anyrail/README.md">README.md</a>
                file.</li>
            <li>Add the <strong>CreateJmriApps.sh</strong> script to the Linux install.  The script
                creates the JMRI application definitions used by the Linux application launchers.
                It also has an option (--desktop or -d) to create desktop icons.</li>
