<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 5.3 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 5.4" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>New warnings for this production release:</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.2.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.2 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.3 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.2.shtml">JMRI 5.3.2</a></span>
        Some images in the <i>resources/icons</i> folder have been renamed.
        Spaces have been changed to underscore. It's images in the
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/ACEI</i>,
        <i>resources\icons\ItalianSignals\Prototypical</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NYC-1956</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/FS-1987</i>, <i>xml/signals/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/NYC-1956</i> and <i>resources/icons/SNCF/Small</i>
        folders that have been renamed. If you are using these images directly, you will need to update the reference.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.1.7.shtml">JMRI 5.1.7</a></span>
        The way defaults for some LocoNet connections are handled has changed.
        Existing LocoNet connections might give a "The Defaults preferences are invalid"
        warning when saving preferences.  In that case, click "yes" and then go set
        all the default radio buttons on the "Defaults" pane to the LocoNet connection.  (You can also
        click "no", but you'll get the message next time you store too)
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.3.shtml">JMRI 5.3.3</a></span>
        The code for Loconet programming operations was significantly changed.
        If you encounter any (new) troubles programming via Loconet, please get in touch on the
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRIusers list</a>.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
        clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
        Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be remembered as the
        last seen report.  The relevant code changes are specific to LocoNet
        Reporters. This might affect your scripts and LogixNG if you were assuming
        the prior behavior.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
        when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
        error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
        this behavior you might have to update them.

This production version is made from test releases 5.3.1 through 5.3.8  The
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-12-07..2023-06-25">full list of changes</a>
in those is
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+merged%3A2022-12-07..2023-06-25">available from our code repository</a>.

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/can/cbus/swing/hubpane/CbusHubPane.shtml">
                    CBUS Hub Control</a> can be used to share the CBUS connection locally and onto a LAN.</li>
                <li>Changed SPROG DCC module IDs to match similar MERG modules,
                    to work around an issue with the FCU tool.</li>
                <li>Improved Node Manager configuratiuon of MERG CANSERVO8C / CANMIO-SVO / CANACC4</li>
                <li>The default behavior for CBus Reporters has been changed to
                    <u>not</u> clear the report after a timeout. A new
                    CbusReporterTimeoutControl.py script is provided to
                    restore the previous behavior:  After a timeout, the
                    report is cleared.  The script also demonstrates how to
                    get a more granular control over this behavior.</li>
                <li>Improved Throttle support for 14 and 28 Speed Steps.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve handling of poll options for network connections.</li>
                <li>Remove extraneous ERROR message when network connections.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>DCC++ and DCC-EX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New script in DCC-EX folder, RosterExportToDCC-EX.py, which outputs all JMRI roster entries in
                format suitable for copying into myAutomation.h.</li>
                <li>Set Turnout userName from Description when defined in myAutomation.h</li>
                <li>Support fastclock synchronization to DCC-EX</li>
                 </ul>

        <h4>ESU</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated how initialization is done to fix a problem where Sensors
                    where not being properly located and operated.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Lenz XPressNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Clarify some internal implementation terminology.</li>
                <li>Add support for up to Fn68 when the Lenz hardware is version 4.0 or later.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New LocoNetSlotsReadCSV.py script which scans all LocoNet slots and
                    creates report about slot status and slots used for the consists
                    including the details of the consist. It also flags all non-zero slots. </li>
                <li>Add Consist number column.</li>
                <li>Support for expanded slots and associated protocol.
                    To enable this the advanced LocoNet preferences must be set XPSlots Auto Detect.
                    If using DCS240(+) limited to less than 120 slots use DCS210 or DCS210+ to avoid needless reading of slots.
                    When using a DCS240(+) be aware that when first opening a Slot Monitor window 430 odd slots are read, so avoid doing it during layout start.
                    If using throttles that cannot access XP Slots along side those that can you may see the same loco number twice in the slotmon, which slot actually has control may vary.</li>
                <li>Changed handling of LACK messages during programming to
                    avoid a recently-uncovered conflict with attached DT602D
                    throttles.</li>
                <li>Added a new jython/loconet directory to contain new LocoNet-specific scripts.</li>
                <li>Added a jython/loconet/LoconetOpsModeSim.py that works with LocoNet simulator
                    to simulate ops-mode writes and reads.</li>
                <li>Added support for the programming protocol used by
                    Digitrax Series 7 boards (DS74, SE74, etc)</li>
                <li>Simplified the display of LocoNet sensor messages in the monitor</li>
                <li>Fixed a problem introduced in JMRI 5.3.3 that caused
                    certain ops-mode programming operations to fail.</li>
                <li>LocoNet connections now support decoder functions up to F68</li>
                <li>Improved handling of BXP88 messages</li>
                <li>The handling for LocoNet Reporters (i.e. transponding)
                    has changed.  See the description
                    <a href="#TLae">below</a>.</li>
                <li>Improved the timeout handling in the Strict packetizer.</li>
                <li>Fixed a problem where sometimes buttons in the Slot Monitor
                    would disappear.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Marklin CS2</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New connection subtype for the CdB system via USB.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A Reporter implementation is now available for MQTT connections.</li>
                <li>Fix typo in Sensor default name; should not have visible effect.</li>
                <li>Added support for variable Lights.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Programmer support added. Enables using DecoderPro on the
                    TCS CS-105 and LT-50 command stations. Service Mode
                    (Programming Track, with Direct Mode) and Ops Mode (Programming
                    on Main) are both supported. RailCom-aware decoders can read
                    CVs on the main (in Ops Mode), which is a lot faster than
                    reading on the Programming Track.</li>
                <li>Updated library to pick up fix to line-ends in hub.</li>
                <li>Hub Control - UI Update, line termination characters optional for incoming feeds.</li>
                <li>When downloading firmware to multiple boards, it can be a pain to have to select the file over and over.
                    This was changed to make the selected file (hence directory, etc) persistent from one download frame
                    to the next.
                <li>Show more information in the node selector when doing firmware downloads.</li>
                <li>Updated the default filename when doing backups to contain more identification info.</li>
                <li>The OpenLCB library was updated to the current contents as of PR #214</li>
                <li>There's a new
                    "<a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/eventtable/EventTablePane.shtml">Event Table</a>"
                    tool that shows all the events on the network and which nodes produce and consume them.</li>
                <li>There's a new
                    "<a href="https://help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/openlcb/swing/memtool/MemoryToolPane.shtml">Memory Tool</a>"
                    that lets you get the contents of node memory spaces into a local binary file, and
                    put the contents of a file back into a node memory space.</li>
                <li>Now shows more about JMRI nodes in the Configure Nodes window.
                <li>Updated the openlcb.jar library to version
                    <a href="https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Java/releases/tag/release-0.7.32">0.7.32</a>
                    including multiple GUI, functional and error handling improvements.
                <li>Add event user name to Monitor display</li>
                <li>Add memory space window display to Memory Tool</li>
                <li>Better ordering for overlapping events in Event Table</li>
                <li>Event table loads all saved event names when opened</li>
                <li>Ensure JMRI source nodes are identified in the Monitor display</li>
                <li>Complete the information in the memory space window</li>
                <li>Performance improvements in the Event Table</li>
                <li>Fix an error preventing multiple configuration windows from working properly</li>
                <li>Fix a timeout error in the hub when running on Windows</li>
                <li>Improved help pages for several tools</li>
                <li>Update <a href="https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Java">OpenLCB_Java library</a> through
                    <a href="https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Java/pulls?q=is%3Apr">PR #228</a> which includes
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add a factory reset option to the configuration More... menu,</li>
                        <li>Limited retry of CDI reads in case of errors.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Fix an NPE from incorrect input when making a Sensor or Turnout.</li>
                <li>Allow an alternate user name format for accessing DCC turnouts connected
                    through a bridge:  MTT123 (note 2nd T) will generate the appropriate
                    events to throw and close DCC turnout 123.
                <li>Fixed a bug that was sometimes preventing the consumer node name info

          that can be used to enable or disable a different Logix.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The action <i>Turnout on LayoutPanel</i> has been added.
          It lets LogixNG enable/disable a turnout on a layout panel.</li>
          <li>The action <i>RunOnce</i> has been added. It runs an action
          only one time. It's useful when something needs to be initialized
          once.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug when importing a Logix with <i>Copy memory</i> to
          LogixNG. The source memory and the destination memory was reversed.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug when importing a Logix to LogixNG, where the Conditional
          uses <i>Mixed</i>. The <i>Not</i> is ignored for the conditional
          variables when using Mixed.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug with the action Entry/Exit and the expression Entry/Exit.
          The action and expression stored the user name instead of the system name
          if the Entry/Exit. The user name of an Entry/Exit changes when the NX sensor
          or related signal mast is changed.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug with the action Timer. If the same sensor is used for both
          start and stop of the timer, the timer didn't restarted after a stop.</li>
          <li>The action Timer can now use the expression <i>Start</i> to both start
          and stop the timer. This is useful if you want to start and stop the timer
          from a single sensor.</li>
          <li>Adds panel file XSLT formatting for display of Digital Actions,
          Expressions, and Boolean Actions in web browser.</li>
          <li>Pressing the F8 key when the spash screen is visible disables all the LogixNGs.</li>
          <li>Pressing the F9 key when the spash screen is visible prevents LogixNG being activated.</li>
          <li>A bug that prevented the <i>Shut down task</i> action to work correctly has been fixed.</li>
          <li>The expression <i>Linux Line Power</i> has been added.</li>
          <li>Cleanup LogixNG controlled Dispatcher train when the train has been terminated by an external action.</li>
          <li>Add a <strong>Section Expression</strong> which is used to get the state of a section.
          The state can be <strong>Free</strong>, <strong>Forward</strong> or <strong>Reverse</strong>.</li>
          <li>Add a <strong>Transit Expression</strong> which is used to get the state of a transit.
          The state can be <strong>Idle</strong> or <strong>Assigned</strong>.</li>
          <li>Apply the <strong>Clock Expression</strong> settings when creating a new expression.</li>
          <li>Enable the <strong>Light Action</strong> data input fields when <strong>Set Intensity
          </strong> or <strong>Set Transition Time</strong> is selected.</li>
          <li>Add the <strong>Web request</strong> action that sends a HTTP or HTTPS request to a web server.</li>
          <li>Add "Entry/Exit" to the "For each" action bean list.</li>
          <li>For the action <i>For each</i>, <i>Variable</i> is renamed to
              <i>Local variable</i> to make it consistent with the naming of
              the rest of LogixNG.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Operations</h3>
         <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
         <ul>
            <li>Fixed a problem when a location has multiple spurs and the spur's schedule forwards the car to another spur
            at the same location with a schedule.  The car's load can incorrectly change to the default "E" or "L" load.</li>
            <li>Improved passenger car blocking when using kernels, caboose, or car with FRED</li>
            <li>Fix Java exception when using the Set Car window and a final destination.</li>
            <li>New staging feature, the ability to have multiple trains on one physical staging track.</li>
            <li>Improved OperationsPro help, paper size, additional links from TOC</li>
            <li>Many improvements to the train build report, car divisions, spurs and schedules, track type, etc.</li>
            <li>A car's wait count is now set to zero if the car's load name is changed</li>
            <li>Track tools now function as soon as track is added</li>

                    made to their speed settings to make them more consistent with
                    the underlying indications.</li>
                <li>The XML Schema for signal systems has been updated to require
                    there be one and only one speed and speed2 setting.</li>
                <li>Pino Di Biasi provided an Italian signal system</li>
                <li>Spaces are no longer allowed in image file names for signal systems.
                    Use underscore instead of space. For example <i>ACEI_Acc_1_vela_giallo.gif</i>

            <li>Consist tool now leverages locomotives icons when available</li>
            <li>A consist selection combo box was introduced</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Timetable</h3>
        <a id="Timetable" name="Timetable"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Add action buttons to <strong>duplicate</strong> the Timetable data items.</li>
            <li>Add the logic to calculate the train route durations.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Preferred format for IdTag xml whenLastSeen field updated to ISO 8601.</li>
            <li>Memory Variable Table - If a Memory Variable value is not empty, the Java Class of the value is displayed as a tooltip.</li>
            <li>ID Tag Tables - Speed improvements when working with large numbers of Tags.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug in the Reporter Table that was causing the
                Last Report column to actually display the Current Report.
                Note that this is just a display bug; the underlying value and
                property change notifications are correct, so this change won't
                affect scripts, LogixNG, etc.</li>
            <li>The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
                clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
                Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be marked as the
                last seen report.  Not all hardware Reporters provide entry/exit reports, as
                some just indicate that something has been observed in place; their "Last Seen" behavior
                has not changed.
                </li>
            <li>Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
                when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
                error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
                this behavior you might have to update them.
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The VSD windows now remember their size and position from one run to another.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <a id="server" name="server"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Update minimatch.js library from 3.0..4 to 3.0.8</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>WiThrottle Server</h3>
        <a id="WS" name="WS"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added an option to request steal from client when an address is already in use</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Update commons-net library from 3.6 to 3.9.0</li>
            <li>Added page breaks when printing panel XML files via browser (using XSLT)</li>
            <li>Improve how fractional clock rates are displayed on the analog clock.</li>
            <li>The shutdown process is now run in a separate thread and not on the GUI/Layout thread.</li>
            <li>Updated the plantuml library to version 1.2023.1.  This is used to
                create program documentation.</li>
            <li>When downloading firmware to multiple boards, it can be a pain to have to select the file over and over.
                This was changed to make the selected file (hence directory, etc) persistent from one download frame
                to the next.
            <li>The NamedIcon class will now search <i>Locations.ALL</i> for files. This means
                <ul>
                <li>Files and filepaths will be found in the user area first for all
                    subclasses of
                    <a href="https://www.jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrit/catalog/NamedIcon.html">NamedIcon</a>.
                <li>This change might result in different graphics in some cases,
                    where it hadn't been
                    searching before and a file was not being found (even though it
                    really should have been). Please check your graphics carefully to
                    see if there are any issues.
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add clickable table of contents to Panel File display/print capability
                (when you open a panel xml file via the JMRI web server)</li>
            <li>New
                <a href="https://jmri.org/jython/anyrail/AnyRailBuildBlockSensorList.py">AnyRailBuildBlockSensorList.py</a>
                script and associated
                <a href="https://jmri.org/jython/anyrail/README.md">README.md</a>
                file.</li>
            <li>Add the <strong>CreateJmriApps.sh</strong> script to the Linux install.  The script
                creates the JMRI application definitions used by the Linux application launchers.
                It also has an option (--desktop or -d) to create desktop icons.</li>
            <li>Improved how window preferences are stored to reduce error messages
                when JMRI is under high load.</li>
            <li>Update the JMRI install process for Raspberry Pi computers running the Raspberry Pi OS.</li>
            <li>Updated the roster and locomotive schema and the locomotive DTD to accept current contents.
                JMRI has been writing extra content in its roster, and the schema and DTD files had not
                kept up.  This resolves that.
            <li>The JOAL library has been updated to run natively on Apple Silicon machines.
            <li>The JInput library has been updated to run natively on Apple Silicon machines.
            <li>Added a new jmri.util.swing.CountingBusyDialog utility class.
            <li>Fixed the XML Schema for IdTags
        </ul>
