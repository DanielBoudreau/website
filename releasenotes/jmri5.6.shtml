<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 5.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 5.6" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>New warnings for this production release:</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.2.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.2 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.3 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li>This release, and all previous ones, have an incompatibility between
        MacOS 13.6 or later and the SPROG support.  The fix for this will be
        in 
        <a href="jmri5.7.1.shtml">JMRI 5.7.1</a>. 
        when it's available.
        Note that this issue only impacts the 
        combination of SPROG and certain MacOS versions.  If you're not using a Mac or 
        not using an SPROG, this will not effect you.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.2.shtml">JMRI 5.3.2</a></span>
        Some images in the <i>resources/icons</i> folder have been renamed.
        Spaces have been changed to underscore. It's images in the
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/ACEI</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/Prototypical</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NYC-1956</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/FS-1987</i>, <i>xml/signals/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/NYC-1956</i> and <i>resources/icons/SNCF/Small</i>
        folders that have been renamed. If you are using these images directly, you will need to update the reference.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.1.7.shtml">JMRI 5.1.7</a></span>
        The way defaults for some LocoNet connections are handled has changed.
        Existing LocoNet connections might give a "The Defaults preferences are invalid"
        warning when saving preferences.  In that case, click "yes" and then go set
        all the default radio buttons on the "Defaults" pane to the LocoNet connection.  (You can also
        click "no", but you'll get the message next time you store too)
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.3.shtml">JMRI 5.3.3</a></span>
        The code for Loconet programming operations was significantly changed.
        If you encounter any (new) troubles programming via Loconet, please get in touch on the
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRIusers list</a>.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
        clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
        Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be remembered as the
        last seen report.  The relevant code changes are specific to LocoNet
        Reporters. This might affect your scripts and LogixNG if you were assuming
        the prior behavior.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
        when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
        error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
        this behavior you might have to update them.
