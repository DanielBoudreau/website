      Release Notes for JMRI 5.5.5 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: Oct 7, 2023</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.5.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.5.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.6 production release in December 2023.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!--
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>MQTT Connection - Version 5.5.5 used the incorrect default MQTT topics for Throttle Direction and Function.
    They had the same topic instead of individual ones.  
    The documentation was correct but the code wasn't.</li>
</ul>

If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri5.5.6.shtml">JMRI 5.5.6</a>, due out early in November 2023.
or pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">JMRI development build installer</a>
with the fix
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        XML files with table contents and panels have been changed in JMRI 5.5.5. It's therefore not
        possible to load an xml file with tables and panels that has been created with JMRI 5.5.5 or
        later with a JMRI version pre 5.5.5.
    </li>
    <li>
        MQTT Connection - Throttle loco address and function placeholders in MQTT topics have changed from
        $address and $function to {0} and {1} for consistency with other objects.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.4.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.4 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.5 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to at least <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this test release.
See <a href="#update">instructions above</a>.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.2.shtml">JMRI 5.3.2</a></span>
        Some images in the <i>resources/icons</i> folder have been renamed.
        Spaces have been changed to underscore. It's images in the
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/ACEI</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/Prototypical</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NYC-1956</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/FS-1987</i>, <i>xml/signals/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/NYC-1956</i> and <i>resources/icons/SNCF/Small</i>
        folders that have been renamed. If you are using these images directly, you will need to update the reference.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
        clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
        Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be remembered as the
        last seen report.  The relevant code changes are specific to LocoNet
        Reporters. This might affect your scripts and LogixNG if you were assuming
        the prior behavior.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
        when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
        error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
        this behavior you might have to update them.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.3.shtml">JMRI 5.5.3</a></span>
        <strong>LocoNet Server</strong> and <strong>LocoNet Client</strong> have been removed.
        If you are using these, you need to change the connection to
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/LbServer.shtml">LocoNet over TCP</a> instead.</li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.3.shtml">JMRI 5.5.3</a></span>
        Scripts that output Logging statements with log4jv1.x ( org.apache.log4j ) imports will stop working 
        from JMRI 5.5.4 and should be updated to use SLF4J logging.
        <br>See <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/12237/files">here</a> for some examples on how to do this.</li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.4.shtml">JMRI 5.5.4</a></span>
        Custom default.lcf Logging Control Files will cease to take effect from JMRI 5.5.4
        <br>To create a custom default_lcf.xml in the new Logging Configuration format, see 
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>

        <h4>SoundTraxx</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added a definition for the Blunami PNP8.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Technologistic (train-O-matic)</h4>

                <li>productID support for all train-O-matic decoders, allows for automatic decoder detection.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Now looks for .txt extension on files being
                imported from the LokProgrammer.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>In auto trains, after stopping, or going to manual, resume correctly even if in a section with no signal.</li>
        </ul>

        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
	        <li>add option(s) for restoring block values, issue #12459</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>A new <strong>LogixNG</strong> icon has been added to Panel Editor.
          When the icon is clicked, it will execute the inline LogixNG of that icon.
          If the inline LogixNG has several ConditionalNGs, the ConditionalNGs will
          be executed in the order they got created.</li>
          <li>A new option is added to the <strong>ConditionalNG</strong> table when
          editing a LogixNG. By default, all the ConditionalNGs are executed when the
          panel is loaded if the LogixNG is enabled. But if the <strong>Startup</strong>
          checkbox is unchecked, the ConditionalNG will not be executed when the panel
          is loaded. This is in particular useful for the <strong>LogixNG</strong> icon
          that's added in this JMRI version.</li>
          <li>A new tool <strong>Where Used</strong> has been added to LogixNG.
          It shows where in the LogixNG tree an item is used. The tool is found
          on menu item <strong>Tools &rArr; LogixNG &rArr; Where Used</strong>.</li>
          <li>A bug in the LogixNG action <strong>Logix</strong> has been fixed. The Logix
          feature <strong>When triggered</strong> didn't work with the LogixNG action
          <strong>Logix</strong> but has now been resolved.</li>
          <li>The action <strong>On Change</strong> has been renamed to <strong>Logix Action</strong>.
          <li>The action <strong>Audio</strong> and the expression <strong>Audio</strong>
          no longer let the user select an Audio buffer when edition the action/expression.
          LogixNG can only act on or listen to Audio sources and the Audio listener so there
          is no point in selecting an audio buffer for LogixNG.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Operations</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>New tools "Preview and Print Car routing report" in the "Set Car" window that provides
            the train routing for a car that has a final destination.</li>
          <li>New tool "Show Staging and Schedules by Car Type and Load" in the "Schedules" window that
            shows which car types and loads are shipped from staging.</li>
          <li>New feature for spurs, the ability to prevent a car's load change. Useful when the
            spur/schedule is used for a RIP track.</li>
          <li>New feature for staging, planned pickups.</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="PE" name="PE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>A new <strong>LogixNG</strong> icon has been added to Panel Editor. When the icon is
            clicked, it will execute the inline LogixNG of that icon. If the inline LogixNG has several
            ConditionalNGs, the ConditionalNGs will be executed in the order they got created.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Shutdown</strong> preference has two options for ignoring special kinds
            of changes.  The first is to ignore fast clock changes, the second ignores the text and
            background color changes for sensors that have been changed to panel labels.</li>
            <li>The startup action <strong>Open file</strong> has been renamed to
            <strong>Load table content and panels</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>YAAT: Change function number limit from 28 to 68.</li>
            <li>YAAT: Add a random delay time: <strong>Wait for &lt;n&gt; [to &lt;n&gt;] seconds</strong></li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Access</h3>
        <a id="WA" name="WA"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Web tables: add click toggle for several additional columns</li>
            <li>JSON Server: support for updating SignalHead and SignalMast Lit and Held</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Take actual speed instead of nominal speed for the distance calculation
                (impact for steam1).</li>
            <li>New option "chuff-fade-out" for steam1, see the
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/tools/vsd/VSDFileAndConfig.shtml#chuff-fade-out">documentation</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved Unrecoverable Error Dialog.</li>
            <li>JMRI now has a "Software Bill of Materials" (SBOM) distributed with it.
                Although this won't matter to most users, it allows people to determine
                via the standardized SPDX mechanism the libraries that JMRI contains and
                the versions being used. Providing this is a small step toward more automated
                distribution.</li>
            <li>UI improvements for the
                <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/jmrit/log/Log4JTreePane.shtml">
                Display / Edit Log Categories</a> dialog.</li>
        </ul>
