      Release Notes for JMRI 5.5.6 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MM DDD, 2023</p>
    <p>From: release pumpkin</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.5.6 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.5.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.6 production release in December 2023.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!--
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

    <li>
        None yet
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.4.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.4 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.5 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to at least <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this test release.
See <a href="#update">instructions above</a>.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.2.shtml">JMRI 5.3.2</a></span>
        Some images in the <i>resources/icons</i> folder have been renamed.
        Spaces have been changed to underscore. It's images in the
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/ACEI</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/Prototypical</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NYC-1956</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/FS-1987</i>, <i>xml/signals/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/NYC-1956</i> and <i>resources/icons/SNCF/Small</i>
        folders that have been renamed. If you are using these images directly, you will need to update the reference.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
        clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
        Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be remembered as the
        last seen report.  The relevant code changes are specific to LocoNet
        Reporters. This might affect your scripts and LogixNG if you were assuming
        the prior behavior.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
        when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
        error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
        this behavior you might have to update them.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.3.shtml">JMRI 5.5.3</a></span>
        <strong>LocoNet Server</strong> and <strong>LocoNet Client</strong> have been removed.
        If you are using these, you need to change the connection to
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/LbServer.shtml">LocoNet over TCP</a> instead.</li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.3.shtml">JMRI 5.5.3</a></span>
        Scripts that output Logging statements with log4jv1.x ( org.apache.log4j ) imports will stop working 
        from JMRI 5.5.4 and should be updated to use SLF4J logging.
        <br>See <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/12237/files">here</a> for some examples on how to do this.</li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.4.shtml">JMRI 5.5.4</a></span>
        Custom default.lcf Logging Control Files will cease to take effect from JMRI 5.5.4
        <br>To create a custom default_lcf.xml in the new Logging Configuration format, see 
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        XML files with table contents and panels have been changed in JMRI 5.5.5. It's therefore not
        possible to load an xml file with tables and panels that has been created with JMRI 5.5.5 or
        later with a JMRI version pre 5.5.5.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        MQTT Connection - Throttle loco address and function placeholders in MQTT topics have changed from
        $address and $function to {0} and {1} for consistency with other objects.

            <ul>
                <li>Fix Both Way route selection.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Note:</strong> If tables and panels are stored with this JMRI version, the file
          might not load in a previous version of JMRI if it includes LogixNG. This is because JMRI
          now stores some LogixNG data in a different way than before.</li>

          <li>The expression <strong>Timer</strong> has been added. It returns <strong>False</strong>
          until some time has passed. It then returns <strong>True</strong> once and the timer starts
          again. This expression is intended to be used together with the action <strong>Sequence</strong></li>.

          <li>The action <strong>Throttle function</strong> has been added. It's similar to the action
          <strong>Throttle</strong>, except that it only sets a function, not speed or direction, and
          that it doesn't have any child actions.</li>

          <li>The action <strong>Sequence</strong> is now safe to use in LogixNG modules. The action
          had a bug which made it sometimes fail if it was used in a module and that module was called
          from several ConditionalNGs at once.</li>

          <li>When a LogixNG was created and ConditionalNGs
          was created for that LogixNG, the ConditionalNGs
          wasn't executing until restart of JMRI if the
          ConditionalNGs had the <strong>Startup</strong>
          flag unchecked. That's fixed now.</li>

          <li>Warrant expression was not listening for warrant events.  Fixed along with the long
          description.</li>

          <li>Add the <strong>GET_BLOCK_WARRANT</strong> and <strong>GET_BLOCK_TRAIN_NAME</strong>
          OBlock actions to the OBlock Logix import.</li>

          <li>The action <strong>Timer</strong> has been improved. It can now be used within a
          LogixNG module. It also supports local variables to tell the different delays for the
          timers in the Timer action.<br>
          To use the Timer action in a LogixNG module, have an <strong>Always true</strong>
          expression as <strong>Start</strong> expression for the Timer action, together with the
          option <strong>Start/Stop by Start expression</strong> selected.</strong></li>

          <li>The action <strong>Audio icon on web panel</strong> is added to the category
          <strong>Display</strong>. This action can tell an <strong>Audio</strong> icon on
          a Panel editor to play the sound when the panel is shown in a web browser, for
          example on a tablet or mobile phone.</li>

          <li>The action <strong>Block</strong> and the expressions <strong>Block</strong>,
          <strong>Dispatcher</strong> and <strong>Sensor</strong> has been refactored.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Operations</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Improvements to the car, locomotive, and train preview and print tools.</li>
            <li>Minor improvement to the train build report when routing.</li>
            <li>Improvements to the router when determining a valid route where multiple trains are using the same route.</li>
            <li>Updates to the OperationsPro help.</li>
            <li>To see all changes to OperationsPro, use the link below</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ADanielBoudreau+archived%3Afalse+is%3Amerged">OperationsPro Changes</a></li>

            <li>It's now possible to select an icon below another icon. Right-click on
            the icon to open the popup menu of the icon. If there are any icons at the
            mouse position below this icon, the sub menu <strong>Icons below</strong>
            will appear at the end of the popup menu. The sub menu will contain all
            the icons below this icon. These menu items will open the popup menu for

            <li>A new <strong>Audio</strong> icon has been added to Panel Editor.
            It can be used to play audio on a web panel, or let the user start
            playing sound in JMRI by clicking on the Audio icon. When editing the
            panel, the popup menu for the icon has a new sub menu <strong>Web
            panels</strong> that sets the options for how the icon should act on
            a web panel.<br>
            If the icon is used to play sound on a web panel, the option
            <strong>Hide when not editing</strong> might be useful if the user
            shouldn't see the icon. The icon plays the sound even if it's not
            visible.<br>
            The LogixNG action <strong>Audio icon on web panel</strong> can be
            used to tell the <strong>Audio</strong> icon to play the sound when
            it is displayed on a web browser, for example on a tablet or mobile
            phone.</li>
