      Release Notes for JMRI 4.99.7 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: May 7, 2022</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 4.99.7 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 4.99.* test releases to migrate JMRI to Java 11.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.0 production release at the end of Spring 2022.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.24, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and

    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        A number of classes and methods that have been deprecated for a long time
        are removed in this release.  These include:
        <ul>
            <li>apps.JmriPlugin</li>
            <li>apps/startup/StartupActionFactory</li>
            <li>Routes/Turnouts/Sensors: One form of getNextAddress</li>
            <li>Handling of preferences from before JMRI 4.0; upgrade through JMRI 4.20 instead</li>
            <li>ShutDownTask, AbstractShutDownTask - use call & run methods now</li>
            <li>Removed JythonAutomaton, JythonAutomatonAction, JythonSiglet, JythonSigletAction
                unused classes.  These have been made obsolete by JMRI's native scripting,
                and haven't been used since JMRI 1.2
            </li>
            <li>SSL (BlockBossLogic) - change to start/stop calls</li>
            <li>Various TrafficManagers.instance methods - use InstanceManager</li>
            <li>Throttle.getListeners() - use getPropertyChangeListeners</li>
            <li>Removed obsolete RosterRecorder class;
                function now available via scripting

    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        The PowerManager now only fires events with the id "power".  Before this
        release, it also fired events with the id "Power". Check that
        your scripting code is looking for the right form.
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This version no longer reads ZeroConf IPv4 and IPv6 preferences
        written with JMRI 4.16 and before.  Please make sure to upgrade
        to JMRI 4.20 (or later) and save your preferences before
        updating to this version if you have configured the WiThrottle preference pane.</li>

          <li>The action <i>Clock Rate</i> has been added. It sets the
          rate of the fast clock.</li>
          <li><i>Global Variables</i> has been added. A Global Variable
          is similar to a Local Variable, except that it is shared among

        </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved display of certain images when rotated for display.<li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The order of presenting these elements in combo boxes
                has been changed to make it more consistent.  They now
                list all user names first, followed by ones with just system
                names.  This also fixes a problem where some items are
                not listed in the combo box.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Any warrant, regular or shared, will not allocate blocks beyond a restricted block.
                A block is <b>restricted</b> if it is:
                <ul>
                   <li>Allocated to another warrant.</li>
                    <li>Occupied by an unknown train.</li>
                    <li>Signal protects it from entry.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                When entering a block, the warrant will allocate as many blocks as it can up to the
                next restricted block or its limit.
                 <ul>
                    <li>Shared warrants only allocate up to a maximum of 2 blocks. (limit is 2)</li>
                    <li>Regular warrants will allocate the full route if no restricted block is found. (unlimited)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Crossovers typically use one turnout to control both switches. Often, each switch is
                track in different blocks. For such shared turnouts, throwing the switch in one block
                may change the path in another block and could cause a derailment.
                 <ul>
                    <li>Warrants now detect shared turnouts. Should the paths in the respective
                    blocks have different settings for the turnout, the warrant will allocate the block
                    sharing the turnout but <b>not</b> set its path.</li>
                    <li>The warrant will stop the train before
                     entering the block. The train will continue when the conflict is resolved.</li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Block status of OUT_OF_SERVICE is informational. Warrants can allocate OUT_OF_SERVICE blocks.
            </li>
            <li>
                The "Set" column of the Warrant List Table is removed. The "Allocate" column indicates the route.
                The path is set if the block is not in a restricted state.
            </li>
            <li>
                When a warrant is running under a speed change restriction, The timing between throttle commands
                has be improved.
            </li>
        </ul>
