      Release Notes for JMRI 5.5.3 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: August 5, 2023</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.5.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!-- 
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.5.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.6 production release in December 2023.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!--
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None yet</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri5.5.4.shtml">JMRI 5.5.4/a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">JMRI development build installer</a>

 -->

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>LocoNet Server</strong> and <strong>LocoNet Client</strong> have been removed.
        If you are using these, you need to change the connection to
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/LbServer.shtml">LocoNet over TCP</a> instead.</li>
    <li>
        Scripts that output Logging statements with log4j should be updated to import sl4fj logging.
        <br><a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/12237/files">See here for some examples</a> on how to do this.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.4.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.4 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.5 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to at least <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this test release.
See <a href="#update">instructions above</a>.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.2.shtml">JMRI 5.3.2</a></span>
        Some images in the <i>resources/icons</i> folder have been renamed.
        Spaces have been changed to underscore. It's images in the
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/ACEI</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/Prototypical</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NYC-1956</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/FS-1987</i>, <i>xml/signals/NW-1981</i>,
        <i>xml/signals/NYC-1956</i> and <i>resources/icons/SNCF/Small</i>
        folders that have been renamed. If you are using these images directly, you will need to update the reference.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
        clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
        Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be remembered as the
        last seen report.  The relevant code changes are specific to LocoNet
        Reporters. This might affect your scripts and LogixNG if you were assuming
        the prior behavior.
        </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.7.shtml">JMRI 5.3.7</a></span>
        Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
        when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
        error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
        this behavior you might have to update them.

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri5.5.2.shtml">Test Release 5.5.2</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=✓&q=milestone%3A5.5.3+is%3Amerged">list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Provided an extra copy of the output data when preparing
                C/MRI output data for a "T" ("Transmit") message type.  This
		prevents a "data buffer overrun" in a pre-configured buffer
		when the output data changes when the process assemble the data.
		(The previous implementation could run out of available bytes
		in the buffer, and the data would not be sent.)</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>DCC++ and DCC-EX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Call "Roster Export to DCC-EX" from DCC++ menu</li>
                <li>Traffic Monitor - Added option to suppress the parsed text</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>LocoNet Server</strong> and <strong>LocoNet Client</strong> have been removed.
                    If you are using these, you need to change the connection to
                    <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/hardware/loconet/LbServer.shtml">LocoNet over TCP</a> instead.
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>OpenLCB library updated through
                    <a href="https://github.com/openlcb/OpenLCB_Java/pulls">PR 231</a>.
                    </li>
                <li>Added a contextual menu (right click, ctrl click) to tabs in the CDI display that
                    contains "Copy" and "Paste" options.
                    Copy and paste works both within one window and across windows.
                    You can only paste into a tab of the same type from which you copied.
                    The data stored in the clipboard is in the format of the usual backup files.
                    </li>
                <li>Added a Send PIP Inquiry button to the Send tool</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Roco z21/Z21</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>JMRI will now leave the layout power unchanged when it terminates.
                    Previously, it would turn the power on if it was off.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SPROG</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Track power ON at startup option would turn on track power but not send packets, 
                    requiring track power to be cycled. Fixed.
                </li>
            </ul>
