      Release Notes for JMRI 5.1.6 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MMM DD, 2022</p>
    <p>From: (release pumpkin)</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.1.6 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.1.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.2 production release in December 2022.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.24, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri5.1.5.shtml">Test Release 5.1.5</a>:</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.

    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>EasyDCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Now able to use turnout numbers up to and including 2044.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Slot Monitor Table can be saved to CSV File via new File Menu.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added connection-specific titles to the menu apps. </li>
            </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>LogixNGs can now be inline in panels. Right-click on a icon on a panel and
          select <i>LogixNG -> Inline</i> to add a LogixNG to a icon on a panel. Inline
          LogixNGs can be viewed by menu item <i>Tools -> LogixNG -> Inline LogixNGs</i>.
          When a ConditionalNG is executed that's inline, two special local variables will
          be defined:
            <ul>
              <li>__InlineLogixNG__ : The name of the icon</li>
              <li>__Editor__ : The name of the editor of the icon</li>
              <li>Note that these two has two underlines at the beginning and end of the name.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Fixes a serious bug when deleting a LogixNG. Not all ConditionalNGs of
          that LogixNG was deleted but that's fixed now.</li>
          <li>Update the Global Variable table browser to provide detail information.</li>
          <li>LogixNG Formula now supports the boolean XOR operator <i>^^</i>.</li>
          <li>The ConditionalNG editor and the Module editor now have the option
          <i>Paste copy</i>. With it, you can paste from the clipboard as many times
          as needed.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Request update of all sensors</i> has been added. It requests
          that all sensors gets updated from the layout.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Create beans from table</i> has been added.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Find table row or column</i> has been added.</li>
          <li>Adds support of multiple types of CSV files to LogixNG Tables.
          Tab separated files are the default, but you may choose Comma
          as the separator. This allows you load CSV files created by
          spreadsheet programs.</li>
          <li>The expression <i>Power</i> now supports the <i>Idle</i> and <i>Unknown</i>
          states. Therefore the option <i>Other</i> has been renamed to <i>On or Off</i>.
          A Power expression that had the state <i>Other</i> now has the state <i>On or Off</i>,
          with <i>Is/IsNot</i> inverted.</li>
          <li>The expression <i>Power</i> can now ignore the <i>Unknown</i> state. Most
          power managers in JMRI sets the state to Unknown before changing the state. This might
          cause problems when using the expression Power with IfThenElse with ExecuteOnChange.</li>
          <li>Additional shortcut keys have been added to the ConditionalNG editor.
            <ul>
              <li>Ctrl + Shift + R: Remove socket</li>
              <li>Ctrl + Shift + D: Enable</li>
              <li>Ctrl + D: Disable</li>
              <li>For macOS, use Cmd instead of Ctrl.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Formula function <i>writeMemory</i> is added. It's in the <i>NamedBean</i> category.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug that crashed the LogixNG debugger when debugging a ConditionalNG
          that calls LogixNG Modules.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>A new script GrandReset.py</a> has been added. The
            script deletes all Transits, Sections and SignalMastLogics.</li>
        </ul>
