      Release Notes for JMRI 5.1.1 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: June 25, 2022</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.1.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of 5.1.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.2 production release in December 2022.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.24, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

        </ul>

            <li>A <strong>Shutdown</strong> preference has been created to support the
            StoreAndCompare process that detects changes to PanelPro tables and panels.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a spurious error message when creating some internal items.</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Several of the PanelPro tables, such as Routes and Logix, display a reminder to store changes before quitting. There are a number of issues with this approach.
                <ul>
                    <li>Only some of the tables have the reminder.
                    <li>Panel changes don't have a reminder.
                    <li>The reminder does not occur when quitting, or if it does, it is too late.
                </ul>
                The JMRI 5.1.1 test release has a global store reminder when running PanelPro.
                DecoderPro is not affected. Any change that affects the stored layout data file will
                trigger a reminder with an option to do a store before the final shutdown.
                <p>
                The global store reminder process is controlled by a new Shutdown option in JMRI Preferences.
                This is located between Start Up and Display. There are a number of scenarios where the
                global store reminder is not appropriate, such as running PanelPro using automatic start up and shutdown.
                See Shutdown Preference for details.
                <p>
                What is considered a change that needs to be stored?
                The process creates a temporary stored file and compares it to the last loaded file.
                If they are different, a store notification will occur.
                The comparison is a line by line compare, not a logical content comparison.
                Listed below are some of the implications of the process.
                <ul>
                    <li>Running PanelPro without loading a layout data file,
                        such as running Operations, a WiThrottle server, etc.
                        Since there is no file to compare to, it is assumed that there might be additions that need to be stored.
                    <li>External events that make changes.
                        Examples are scripts that create new table entries,
                        new hardware that can generate table entries, such as adding a DS64 on LocoNet, etc.
                    <li>JMRI version changes. These can be significant, such as new features.
                        Or trivial because the sequence of rows are in a different order in the layout data file.
                        This last one affects layout data files from JMRI 4.26 that use signal heads and SSL.
                </ul>
                The compare process stops with the first occurrence of a potential change.
                The details of the compared lines are listed in the JMRI system console (Help => System Console).



            <li>Minor changes to resolve Spotbug OS_OPEN_STREAM_EXCEPTION_PATH </li>
            <li>Minor changes to resolve Spotbug ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD </li>
        </ul>
