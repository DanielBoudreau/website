      Release Notes for JMRI 5.3.7 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MM DDD, 2023</p>
    <p>From: release pumpkin</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.3.7 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.3.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.4 production release in June 2023.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the
<a href="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

<a id="problems" name="problems"></a>
<h3>New problems with this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li>None yet</li>
</ul>
<!--
If any of those affect you, please either
wait for
<a href="jmri5.3.8.shtml">JMRI 5.3.8</a>, due out shortly after this one,
or (once there's a fix for the problem) pick up a
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">JMRI development build installer</a>
from
<a href="https://builds.jmri.org/jenkins/job/development/job/packages/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
 -->

<a id="warnings" name="warnings"></a>
<h3>New warnings for this release:</h3>

<ul>

    <li>The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
        clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
        Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be remembered as the
        last seen report.  The relevant code changes are specific to LocoNet
        Reporters. This might affect your scripts and LogixNG if you were assuming
        the prior behavior.
        </li>
    <li>Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
        when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
        error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
        this behavior you might have to update them.
</ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.2.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.2 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.3 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to at least <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this test release.
See <a href="#update">instructions above</a>.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.2.shtml">JMRI 5.3.2</a></span>
        Some images in the <i>resources/icons</i> folder have been renamed.
        Spaces have been changed to underscore. It's images in the <i>resources/icons/ItalianSignals/ACEI</i>,
        <i>resources\icons\ItalianSignals\Prototypical</i>,
        <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NW-1981</i>, <i>resources/icons/smallschematics/aspects/NYC-1956</i>,

        folders that have been renamed. If you are using these images directly, you will need to update the reference.
    </li>
     <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.1.7.shtml">JMRI 5.1.7</a></span>
        The way defaults for some LocoNet connections are handled has changed.
        Existing LocoNet connections might give a "The Defaults preferences are invalid"
        warning when saving preferences.  In that case, click "yes" and then go set
        all the default radio buttons on the "Defaults" pane to the LocoNet connection.  (You can also
        click "no", but you'll get the message next time you store too)
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/JVMCapabilities.shtml">JVM Capabilities</a> pages.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.3.3.shtml">JMRI 5.3.3</a></span>
        The code for Loconet programming operations was significantly changed.
        If you encounter any (new) troubles programming via Loconet, please get in touch on the
        <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">JMRIusers list</a>.

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri5.3.6.shtml">Test Release 5.3.6</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A5.3.7+is%3Amerged">list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The default behavior for CBus Reporters has been changed to
                    <u>not</u> clear the report after a timeout. A new
                    CbusReporterTimeoutControl.py script is provided to
                    restore the previous behavior:  After a timeout, the
                    report is cleared.  The script also demonstrates how to
                    get a more granular control over this behavior.</li>
                <li>Improved Throttle support for 14 and 28 Speed Steps.</li>
            </ul>

                    has changed.  See the description
                    <a href="#TLae">below</a>.</li>
                <li>Improved the timeout handling in the Strict packetizer.</li>
                <li>Fixed a problem where sometimes buttons in the Slot Monitor
                    would disappear.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Roco z21/Z21</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a delay to read/write programming operations on the main.

            <li>Made "ignore all" the default setting for the car set window</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Restored the linking input field when adding labels.  This had been
                inadvertently removed some time in the past.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>New AnyRail/AnyRailExportAdditions.py. For use with AnyRail export. Creates hardware occupancy Sensors and Turnouts,

        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>
        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The BR-2003 system now has medium-size semaphore icons.</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

    <h3>Throttle</h3>
        <a id="throttle" name="throttle"></a>
            <li>Some minor internal cleanup.</li>
            <li>If you select a roster entry, the throttle displays functions up to the
                least of the number of functions available
                from the layout connection, or the maximum function in the decoder
                definition.
                For most decoders, this will be 28,
                but there are a few definitions that are larger or smaller.</li>
            <li>Added a consist selector in the address panel</li>
            <li>Added a "Consist Tool" button in the address panel</li>
            <li>Behavior with consists enhanced</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Consist Tool</h3>
        <a id="consist" name="consist"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Consist Control" entry in the "Tools" menu was renamed "Consist Tool"</li>
            <li>Consist tool now leverages locomotives icons when available</li>
            <li>A consist selection combo box was introduced</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug in the Reporter Table that was causing the
                Last Report column to actually display the Current Report.
                Note that this is just a display bug; the underlying value and
                property change notifications are correct, so this change won't
                affect scripts, LogixNG, etc.</li>
            <li>The definition of "Last Seen" for Id Tags has been
                clarified to mean "Location where the tag was last seen to be <u>present</u>".
                Previously, a report that a tag was <u>absent</u> could be marked as the
                last seen report.  Not all hardware Reporters provide entry/exit reports, as
                some just indicate that something has been observed in place; their "Last Seen" behavior
                has not changed.
                </li>
            <li>Some Reporters, particularly LocoNet, would improperly clear an "enter" report
                when an "exits" report for the same tag was seen elsewhere.  This was an
                error that has been fixed, but if you have scripts or LogixNG that depend on
                this behavior you might have to update them.
        </ul>

   <h3>Virtual Sound Decoder</h3>
        <a id="VSD" name="VSD"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>The VSD windows now remember their size and position from one run to another.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved how window preferences are stored to reduce error messages
                when JMRI is under high load.</li>
            <li>Update the JMRI install process for Raspberry Pi computers running the Raspberry Pi OS.</li>
            <li>Updated the roster and locomotive schema and the locomotive DTD to accept current contents.
                JMRI has been writing extra content in its roster, and the schema and DTD files had not
                kept up.  This resolves that.
            <li>The JOAL library has been updated to run natively on Apple Silicon machines.
            <li>The JInput library has been updated to run natively on Apple Silicon machines.
            <li>Added a new jmri.util.swing.CountingBusyDialog utility class.
            <li>Fixed the XML Schema for IdTags
        </ul>
