      Release Notes for JMRI 5.1.5 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: Oct 7, 2022</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.1.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.1.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.2 production release in December 2022.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.24, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

          <li>Keyboard support has been added to the ConditionalNG editor.
            <ul>
              <li>
                When <i>Preferences -> LogixNG</i> option <i>Highlight row in
                ConditionalNG editor</i> is enabled, use the arrow keys to move to the
                desired row and then use one of the shortcut keys.
              </li>
              <li>
                Except for the N shortcut key, the other shortcut keys are available in

              </li>
              <li>Shortcut keys:
                <ul>
                  <li>Ctrl + N: Create new</li>
                  <li>Ctrl + E: Edit</li>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            LogixNG has now two new options that work together:
            <ul>
              <li><i>Preferences -> LogixNG</i> has the option
              <i>Show system name in exceptions</i>. If it's checked, the system name
              of an action/expression will be shown in the error message in the log if
              an error occurs and <i>Abort</i> is selected in the error dialog.</li>
              <li><i>LogixNG Browse</i> has the option <i>Print system names</i>. If
              this option is checked, the system names of actions and expressions is
              shown in the Browse window.</li>
            </ul>
            These two options together makes it easier to find in which action or
            expression the error occurs.</li>
            <li>The <i>If Then Else</i> action has two new options that's relevant when
            there's more that one <i>If</i> socket.
            <ul>
              <li><i>Evaluate all expressions</i> - evaluates all the <i>If</i> sockets before executing any action.</i>
              <li><i>Evaluate needed expressions</i> - evaluates the <i>If</i> sockets until one expression returns True.</i>
            </ul>
            Note that when <i>If Then Else</i> got support for <i>Else_If</i> statements in JMRI 5.1.3, it worked as
            <i>Evaluate needed expressions</i> it has now changed to <i>Evaluate all expressions</i>, unless the user changes
            it. For most cases, this will be just fine, but there might be rare cases where this matters.
          </li>
          <li></li>
          <li>The new action <i>Shut down task</i> executes an action when JMRI shuts down.</li>
          <li>The new LocoNet action <i>Set speed zero</i> sets the speed to zero for all the
          LocoNet slots.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
        <a id="Resources" name="Resources"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Purple on, off icons added to USS sensor directory.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>

            <li>Updated File Chooser to enable directories to be selectable.</li>
