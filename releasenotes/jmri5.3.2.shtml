      Release Notes for JMRI 5.3.2 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: January 14, 2023</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.3.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<!--
<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>
 -->

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.3.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.4 production release in June 2023.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

        folders that have been renamed. If you are using these images directly, you will need to update the reference.
    </li>
 </ul>


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

See the <a href="jmri5.2.shtml#warnings">JMRI 5.2 release note</a> for more warnings predating the 5.3 development series,
including pointers to various migration issues.
These may be relevant to you if you're updating from an earlier version;
we strongly recommend you update to at least <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>
before installing this test release.
See <a href="#update">instructions above</a>.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.1.7.shtml">JMRI 5.1.7</a></span>
        The way defaults for some LocoNet connections are handled has changed.
        Existing LocoNet connections might give a "The Defaults preferences are invalid"
        warning when saving preferences.  In that case, click "yes" and then go set
        all the default radio buttons on the "Defaults" pane to the LocoNet connection.  (You can also
        click "no", but you'll get the message next time you store too)
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri5.3.1.shtml">Test Release 5.3.1</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A5.3.2+is%3Amerged">list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Support for expanded slots and associated protocol.
                    To enable this the advanced LocoNet preferences must be set XPSlots Auto Detect.
                    If using DCS240(+) limited to less than 120 slots use DCS210 or DCS210+ to avoid needless reading of slots.
                    When using a DCS240(+) be aware that when first opening a Slot Monitor window 430 odd slots are read, so avoid doing it during layout start.
                    If using throttles that cannot access XP Slots along side those that can you may see the same loco number twice in the slotmon, which slot actually has control may vary.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A Reporter implementation is now available for MQTT connections.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Programmer support added. Enables using DecoderPro on the
                TCS CS-105 and LT-50 command stations. Service Mode
                (Programming Track, with Direct Mode) and Ops Mode (Programming
                on Main) are both supported. RailCom-aware decoders can read
                CVs on the main (in Ops Mode), which is a lot faster than
                reading on the Programming Track.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>

        <h4>Piko</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Piko Smart Decoder 4.1 and XP5.1</li>
		<li>Add CVs 100, 101 for Function Mapping Shift on Piko Smart Decoder 4.1</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Uhlenbrock</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Added Tillig BR 89 steam loco on several panes</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Some internal state constants have been changed from integer values
                to an enum.  This should not have any external effect.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixes a bug when importing a Logix to LogixNG, where the Conditional
          uses <i>Mixed</i>. The <i>Not</i> is ignored for the conditional
          variables when using Mixed.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug with the action Entry/Exit and the expression Entry/Exit.
          The action and expression stored the user name instead of the system name
          if the Entry/Exit. The user name of an Entry/Exit changes when the NX sensor
          or related signal mast is changed.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug with the action Timer. If the same sensor is used for both
          start and stop of the timer, the timer didn't restarted after a stop.</li>
          <li>The action Timer can now use the expression <i>Start</i> to both start
          and stop the timer. This is useful if you want to start and stop the timer
          from a single sensor.</li>
          <li>Adds panel file XSLT formatting for display of Digital Actions,
          Expressions, and Boolean Actions in web browser.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Operations</h3>
         <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
         <ul>
             <li>Fixed a problem when a location has multiple spurs and the spur's schedule
             forwards the car to another spur
             at the same location with a schedule.
             The car's load can incorrectly change to the default "E" or "L" load.</li>
         </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Kevin Appleby provided a script for doing serial transfer from the Light Table.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signals</h3>
        <a id="Signals" name="Signals"></a>

        <h4>Signal Systems</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pino Di Biasi provided an Italian signal system</li>
                <li>Spaces are no longer allowed in image file names for signal systems.
                Use underscore instead of space. For example <i>ACEI_Acc_1_vela_giallo.gif</i>
                instead of <i>ACEI Acc 1 vela giallo.gif</i></li>
            </ul>
