      Release Notes for JMRI 5.7.2 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MM DDD, 2023</p>
    <p>From: release pumpkin</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.7.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of 5.7.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.8 production release in June 2024.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<!--
<P>We are getting close to the next production release, so we would particularly
appreciate your testing of this release to make sure it works for you. That way,
if you find new problems, we can try to fix them before the production release.</P>
 -->

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.
We would appreciate your feedback on it.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 5.0, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

<ul>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri4.99.1.shtml">JMRI 4.99.1</a></span>
        This test release, and all subsequent ones, require the use of
        Java 11 or later.  Java 8 is explicitly not supported.
        There's more information on this migration on the
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">JMRI Tech Road Map</a> and

    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.3.shtml">JMRI 5.5.3</a></span>
        Scripts that output Logging statements with log4jv1.x ( org.apache.log4j ) imports will stop working 
        from JMRI 5.5.4 and should be updated to use SLF4J logging.
        <br>See <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/pull/12237/files">here</a> for some examples on how to do this.</li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.4.shtml">JMRI 5.5.4</a></span>
        Custom default.lcf Logging Control Files will cease to take effect from JMRI 5.5.4
        <br>To create a custom default_lcf.xml in the new Logging Configuration format, see 
        <a href="https://www.jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/Debug.shtml">JMRI Debugging and Logging</a>
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        XML files with table contents and panels have been changed in JMRI 5.5.5. It's therefore not
        possible to load an xml file with tables and panels that has been created with JMRI 5.5.5 or
        later with a JMRI version pre 5.5.5.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.5.5.shtml">JMRI 5.5.5</a></span>
        MQTT Connection - Throttle loco address and function placeholders in MQTT topics have changed from
        $address and $function to {0} and {1} for consistency with other objects.
    </li>
    <li><span class="since">Since <a href="jmri5.7.1.shtml">JMRI 5.7.1</a></span>
        Several systems have had extensive updates to their serial
        support.  If you have trouble connecting to your layout hardware

<h2>Changes since <a href="jmri5.7.1.shtml">Test Release 5.7.1</a>:</h2>

The <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=milestone%3A5.7.2+is%3Amerged">list of included changes</a> is available from our
<a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">GitHub code repository</a>.


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>
        <h4>Acela CTI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Acela CTI serial connections have been updated to use a new serial library.</li>  
            </ul>

        <h4>C/MRI</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>C/MRI serial now uses 2 stop bits, which solves communication
                    issues on certain hardware.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>DCC++ and DCC-EX</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A problem with serial communications introduced in 5.7.1 has been fixed.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Direct</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Direct DCC serial connections have been updated to use a new serial library.</li>  
            </ul>

        <h4>Maple</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Maple serial connections have been updated to use a new serial library.</li>  
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The new Jython script <strong>jython/MQTT/MqttSignalHead2.py</strong>
                has been added. It's an improvement of jython/MQTT/MqttSignalHead.py
                as it doesn't need any manual configuration to work.</li>
                <li>Made certain error messages specific to a single device.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>NCE</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>NCE serial connections have been updated to use a new serial library.</li>
                <li>Clock, Macro, and Consist added and improved error notification to user
               	when invalid inputs entered. Prior these were silently ignored or only
               	logged to the console.</li>
               	<li>NCE Packet Analyzer has internal improvements to prevent errors due to port not
               	being open. Duplicates are now given as a count instead of a row of +++ as
               	the time stamp wasn't being placed correctly and a count is more meaningful.
               	The option to close the connection was added to manage selecting a different
               	port. It now supports the old and new versions of the analyzer. Reworked the 
               	user interaction options to be easier to use and understand.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Oak Tree</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Oak Tree serial connections have been updated to use a new serial library.</li>  
            </ul>

        <h4>Secsi</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>SECSI serial connections have been updated to use a new serial library.</li>  
            </ul>

        <h4>SPROG</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A problem with serial communications introduced in 5.7.1 has been fixed.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>TAMS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>TAMS serial connections have been updated to use a new serial library.</li>  
            </ul>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>
        <h4>Digitrax</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated LocoNet Monitor to display PM74 and SE74 device
		            types for certain LocoNet messages.</li>
                <li>Added DN163K5B decoder</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Leb</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed XML files when cross-referencing additional decoder details.</li>

            </ul>

        <h4>Trix Modelleisenbahn</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix URIs in the xml/decoders/trix/mLD_mSD_functionmap.xml that were pointing to
                    http://jmri.oSound6/xml/   This should be pointing to: http://jmri.org/xml/</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a SplitHundredsVal which defines a large value
                split across multiple CVs in groups of two decimal digits.
                This is used by the new Logic Rail Tech definition.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Layout Editor</h3>
        <a id="LE" name="LE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not display tooltips for hidden items.</li>
            <li>Do not reset all tooltip settings for Always or Never tooltip selections when changing
            the editor mode.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> If tables and panels are stored
                with this JMRI version, the file might not load in a
                previous version of JMRI if it includes LogixNG. This is
                because JMRI now stores some LogixNG data in a different
                way than before.</li>
            <li>Add Audio support to Where Used.</li>
            <li>The action <strong>Local Variable</strong> can now set
                a constant of different types: <strong>String</strong>,
                <strong>Integer</strong>, <strong>Floating number</strong>,
                <strong>Boolean</strong>.</li>
            <li>The LogixNG table now shows whenether the ConditionalNGs
                of a LogixNG has <strong>Startup</strong> enabled or not.
                The <strong>Startup</strong> checkbox in the LogixNG
                table can have three states: Checked, unchecked and
                partially checked. If the user checks/unchecks the
                checkbox, all the ConditionalNGs will have the
                <strong>Startup</strong> enabled/disabled.
                <br>
                The column <strong>Startup</strong> is at the far right
                in the LogixNG table. You might need to resize the table
                to see the new column.
                <br>
                Note: Due to a bug, <strong>Startup</strong> might not
                be shown as checkboxes but of text labels that cannot be
                changed. To change <strong>Startup</strong> in this case,
                edit the LogixNG and change <strong>Startup</strong> for
                each ConditionalNG.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="PE" name="PE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not display tooltips for hidden items.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Control Panel Editor</h3>
        <a id="CPE" name="CPE"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not display tooltips for hidden items.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Where Used</h3>
        <a id="WhereUsed" name="WhereUsed"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Add Audio support.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Z21 App Server</h3>
        <a id="Z21" name="Z21"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added basic throttle function with the Roco Z21 Application on smartphones and tablets</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <a id="server" name="server"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Now displays "index.shtml" files if present in a directory.</li>
        </ul>
