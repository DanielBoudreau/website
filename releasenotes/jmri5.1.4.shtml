      Release Notes for JMRI 5.1.4 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MMM DD, 2022</p>
    <p>From: (release pumpkin)</p>
    <p>Subject: Test Release 5.1.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>This is a test release.  Please
<a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">post a note</a>
if you encounter any new or old bugs!
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of 5.1.* test releases.
It requires Java 11 to work.
(See <a href="http://jmri.org/java">our page on downloading Java 11</a>)
We expect this series to end in the next JMRI 5.2 production release in December 2022.
(See the <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open"><em>tentative</em> release schedule</a>)
</p>

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.
Therefore, this test release should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.24, please follow these instructions carefully:
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name, use those from now on, and go on to step 3.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.24.shtml">JMRI 4.24</a>?
