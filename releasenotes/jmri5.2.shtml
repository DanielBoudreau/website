      Release Notes for JMRI 5.2 release
      </h1>

    <p>Date: MMM DD, 2022</p>
    <p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
    <p>Subject: Production Release 5.0 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>

<p><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b></p>

<p>We are very pleased to announce that the 5.1 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production Release 5.2" available for download today.</p>

<h3>Update From Older JMRI Versions</h3>

If you are currently using a version older than JMRI 4.20, please follow these instructions carefully:
<!-- Note:  At this point, we're not requiring an update to 4.22; change if needed-->
<ol>
<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a>?
    If so, then update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> first, and ensure everything works correctly: check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.
    Then continue with step 2.
    <p>
    If you are currently using JMRI 4.7.3 or earlier on Linux or macOS (Windows doesn't need this),
    then it's <u>very important</u>
    that you update to <a href="jmri4.12.shtml">JMRI 4.12</a> and
    carrying out the <a href="jmri4.12.shtml#migration">migration process described in the JMRI 4.12 release note</a>
    before updating to any later release.
    </li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri4.20.shtml">JMRI 4.20</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>Is your current version older than <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a>?
    Then update to <a href="jmri5.0.shtml">JMRI 5.0</a> first, and ensure that works correctly (check
    start-up, check things you need to be working, and check the JMRI log as well) before doing anything else.
    Save your preferences again.
    Store your configuration and panel files under a new name and use those from now on.</li>

<li>You can then install this release.

</ol>

Following this multi-step order of updating via stable major releases safeguards you against possible migration issues
that can arise from skipping these versions.

        The way defaults for some LocoNet connections are handled has changed.
        Existing LocoNet connections might give a "The Defaults preferences are invalid"
        warning when saving preferences.  In that case, click "yes" and then go set
        all the default radio buttons on the "Defaults" pane to the LocoNet connection.  (You can also
        click "no", but you'll get the message next time you store too)

<!-- ======== 5.1.1 ================================================== -->


    <h3>Hardware Support</h3>

        <h4>CBUS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated [Pi-]SPROG (3v2|Plus) NV edit GUI</li>
                <li>Added Pi-SPROG 3 (not v2) NV edit GUI</li>
                <li>Improved Node Manager and Event Table support for multiple CBUS Connections.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>EasyDCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Now able to use turnout numbers up to and including 2044.</li>
                <li>Now allows adding multiple new turnouts at the same time.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>LocoNet</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The DCS240+ doesn't accept service-mode read
                    requests for about 350-400msec after the completion of the prior one.
                    A short delay has been added to handle this.</li>
                <li>Slot Monitor Table can be saved to CSV File via new File Menu.</li>
                <li>You can now select separate defaults (in the Preferences -> Defaults pane)
                for additional types of LocoNet connections.
                <p>
                Note: Existing LocoNet connections might give a "The Defaults preferences are invalid"
                warning when saving preferences.  In that case, click "yes" and then go set
                all the default radio buttons on the "Defaults" pane to the LocoNet connection.  (You can also
                click "no", but you'll get the message next time you store too)</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>MQTT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rewrite and expansion of documentation.</li>
                <li>The default value of the channel is now "", the null string.
                    The channel name is prefixed to all of JMRI's publish and subscribe
                    operations.  The previous default was "/trains/"
            </ul>

        <h4>NCE</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a problem adding sensors with names like NS50:1
                </li>
                <li>Internationalization of the NCE tools was completed. New items are available for
                  translation.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a> / LCC</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix a problem with the OpenLCB hub at high data rates. Overlapping
                    messages and replies would be echoed out incorrectly.
                </li>
                <li>Several fixes to JMRI's OpenLCB hub to reduce chance of duplicated traffic.</li>
                <li>Added ConsumerID, ProducerID buttons to OpenLCB console</li>
                <li>Updated openlcb.jar to pick up "send AMD in response to AME" fix.</li>
                <li>Updated OpenLCB library to include PR #205. Now properly
                    sends AMD in response to relevant AME.</li>
                <li>Added connection-specific titles to the menu apps. </li>
                <li>Added new service scripts in the scripts/LCC directory:
                <ul>
                    <li>DisplayTrackCircuit.py - This script manages a set of sensors to follow a
                        RR-CirKits track circuit. It uses 8 sensors in a state machine to update a
                        memory for text display of the track circuit state.

                    <li>SetSignalNodeDefaults.py - This script will populate the sensor and turnout
                        tables with many default entries for a Signal LCC node.

                    <li>SetTowerNodeDefaults.py - This script will populate the sensor and turnout
                        tables with many default entries for a Tower LCC node.
                </ul>
                See comments within the scripts for more info.
                <p>
                Note: The Set*Defaults scripts create a large number of sensors and turnout
                entries. This makes the connection monitor easier to read as you get names for
                everything instead of just numbers. But it also slows down the startup as those
                items get loaded during startup and synced to the nodes.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Piko</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A new definition file was added for the Uhlenbrock LocoNet IR Receiver #63830, that can
            connect the Piko Digi-fern Remote Control to LocoNet.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Raspberry Pi</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A simulator is now added that simulates a Raspberry Pi.
                The simulator is very simple and is mostly intended to be
                able to load panels for a Raspberry Pi on a non Pi computer
                like Windows.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SPROG</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated [Pi-]SPROG (3v2|Plus) NV edit GUI</li>
                <li>Added Pi-SPROG 3 (not v2) NV edit GUI</li>
                <li>Added F29+ support to SPROG Command Station mode.</li>
                <li>Added option for offset between CBUS events and DCC accessory addresses
                    for [Pi-]SPROG 3 Plus firmware 3.e Beta 2.</li>
                <li>Improved display of programmer availability in PanelPro Tools menu.</li>
                <li>Fixed timeout warnings during programming.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Uhlenbrock Intellibox</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed bugs in Daisy II (model 65200) definition</li>
              <li>New definition for Daisy II model 65210. Uses LNCV programming just as 65200</li>
              <li>Daisy II family renamed to "Command Station" (was "Handheld Throttle")</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>New / Updated decoder definitions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>An include file enum-WeekdaysSun.xml that can be used to create a drop down of Weekdays was added to
            xml/decoders/parts/</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Dapol</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Two Dapol Imperium DCC Decoders have been added.<br>
                860015: Next 18 6 Function decoders (NEM 662).<br>
                860019: 21 PIN 6 Function decoders (21MTC/NEM 660/MTX interface Standard).</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Digikeijs (Digirails)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New decoder definition for DR5088RC with LNCV programming capabilities.<br>

                <li>Updated the Lissy Reporter support, including
                improved display of the messages. Note that this
                has changed the format of the reports, so users
                who have written scripts to use this might need to
                check and update them.</li>
                <li>Added a decoder definition to configure the 63810 Mobile Station Adapter.<br>

            </ul>

        <h4>ZIMO</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New decoder definitions for Firmware 40.18</li>
                <li>Nigel Cliffe did a
                <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues/11608">large update to the Zimo definitions</a></li>
            </ul>

    <h3>DecoderPro</h3>
        <a id="DecoderPro" name="DecoderPro"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a problem preventing import of CSV files exported from JMRI.
            </li>
            <li>To simplify writing a decoder definition, variable declarations for decimal and hex values without a
              "mask" with max &gt; 255  now will get an appropriately sized mask assigned so that they store any
              valid entry.<br>
              Variables with a max &lt;= 255 or with an explicit mask are not affected.
            </li>
          <li>In decoder definitions, enumVal variables can now use a so-called "radix" mask to map values on specific
            digits in the CV value. Requires decoder-4-15-2.xsd schema in the xml declaration.</li>
            <li>Values of type DecVar can now be presented using an offset and factor to reflect their application. For
              example if address 1 had to be entered as 0 (and 2 as 1) an offset of +1 would fix this for the user.
              Likewise, a factor of 50 would present a setting "in steps of 50 milliseconds" in ms units while saving
              it in the CV just like it used to.<br>
              Requires schema decoder-4-15-2.xsd. When a min or max is applied, the author should update that for the
              numbers as entered. Entries smaller than the offset are replaced by 0.
            </li>
            <li>Menu items were harmonized with the button alternatives.</li>
            <li>Single CV programmer now checks for availability of global programmer.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Dispatcher</h3>
        <a id="Dispatcher" name="Dispatcher"></a>
        <ul>
             <li>Separated reverse at end delays from reset delays</li>
             <li>Allow a next traininfo to be run at successful termination using the same loco info</li>
             <li>Support transits and sections that use multiple panels connected by edge
             connectors.</li>
             <li>The "Use connectivity from Layout Editor panels" option in Dispatcher Options
             no longer uses a specified panel.  All Layout Editor panels are used for layout
             connectivity.</li>
             <li>Always on top option for AutoTrainsFrame</li>
             <li>Cancel timers on stop immediate</li>

   <h3>Internationalization</h3>
        <a id="I18N" name="I18N"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>See NCE tools above.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>LogixNG</h3>
        <a id="LogixNG" name="LogixNG"></a>
        <ul>
          <li>The MQTT action now has the option <i>Remove channel from topic</i>.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Listen On Beans</i> now sorts the named beans when selecting a bean to listen on.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Simulate turnout feedback</i> has been added.
          It's useful to simulate feedback based turnout actions when a
          simulator connection is used, for example the <i>LocoNet simulator</i>.</li>
          <li>The expression <i>Connection name</i> has been added.
          It's useful together with <i>Simulate turnout feedback</i> so
          that simulation only happens for simulated connections.</li>
          <li>The action <i>For each</i> has been added. It's useful when
          you want to loop thru all items in a list, for example all the
          sensors in the sensor manager.</li>
          <li>The formula function <i>new</i> has been added. It allows
          you to create a new instance of a class.</li>
          <li>Several formula constants have been added. See the modules
          <i>Java</i> and <i>Layout</i>. Examples are constants like
          <i>sensors</i> and <i>turnouts</i> that gives you direct access
          to the managers. And <i>InstanceManager</i> that gives you direct
          access to the instance manager. The constants <i>null</i> and
          <i>None</i> has the null value in Java, the None value in Jython.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Listen On Beans - Table</i> is improved.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Listen On Beans - Local variable</i> has been
          added. It can be used together with the <i>For each</i> action
          to listen to all beans of a manager.</li>
          <li>The expressions <i>Local Variable</i> and <i>Memory</i> now
          have the choice "Type" which allows you to select whenether the
          data should be treated as a number or a string. If "Number" is
          choosen, it's required that both operands are numbers. Otherwise
          an exception will occur.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Local Variable</i> can now copy the value of a
          reference.</li>
          <li>The action <i>If Then Else</i> now supports <i>Else_If</i>
          statements.</li>
          <li>The new category <i>Flow Control</i> is added. The actions
          <i>Call Module</i>, <i>For</i>, <i>For Each</i>, <i>Table: For
          Each</i> and <i>Sequence</i> are moved to this category, as well
          as the expression <i>Call Module</i>.</li>
          <li>The actions <i>Break</i>, <i>Continue</i>, <i>Error</i>,
          <i>Exit</i> and <i>Return</i> have been added to the <i>Flow
          Control</i> category.</li>
          <li>The expressions <i>And</i> and <i>Or</i> now have the option
          to only evaluate the sockets that are needed for the result.</li>
          <li>The popup menu in the ConditionalNG editor is changed.
          All the categories are sub menus to the <i>Add</i> menu item.
          When a new action or expression is to be created, it is
          selected directly in the popup menu.</li>
          <li>The expression <i>Local variable as analog value</i>
          has been added.</li>
          <li>LogixNG now prints <i>(Listen)</i> or <i>(No Listen)</i> when
          memories are used as addressing. It also prints <i>::: No Listen</i>
          for expressions where the option <i>Listen</i> is unchecked.
          </li>
          <li>Keyboard support has been added to the ConditionalNG editor.
            <ul>
              <li>
                When <i>Preferences -> LogixNG</i> option <i>Highlight row in
                ConditionalNG editor</i> is enabled, use the arrow keys to move to the
                desired row and then use one of the shortcut keys.
              </li>
              <li>
                Except for the N shortcut key, the other shortcut keys are available in
                the right click popup menu.
              </li>
              <li>Shortcut keys:
                <ul>
                  <li>Ctrl + N: Create new</li>
                  <li>Ctrl + E: Edit</li>
                  <li>Ctrl + R: Remove</li>
                  <li>Ctrl + X: Cut</li>
                  <li>Ctrl + C: Copy</li>
                  <li>Ctrl + V: Paste</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                For macOS, use Cmd instead of Ctrl.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            LogixNG has now two new options that work together:
            <ul>
              <li><i>Preferences -> LogixNG</i> has the option
              <i>Show system name in exceptions</i>. If it's checked, the system name
              of an action/expression will be shown in the error message in the log if
              an error occurs and <i>Abort</i> is selected in the error dialog.</li>
              <li><i>LogixNG Browse</i> has the option <i>Print system names</i>. If
              this option is checked, the system names of actions and expressions is
              shown in the Browse window.</li>
            </ul>
            These two options together makes it easier to find in which action or
            expression the error occurs.</li>
            <li>The <i>If Then Else</i> action has two new options that's relevant when
            there's more that one <i>If</i> socket.
            <ul>
              <li><i>Evaluate all expressions</i> - evaluates all the <i>If</i> sockets before executing any action.</i>
              <li><i>Evaluate needed expressions</i> - evaluates the <i>If</i> sockets until one expression returns True.</i>
            </ul>
            Note that when <i>If Then Else</i> got support for <i>Else_If</i> statements in JMRI 5.1.3, it worked as
            <i>Evaluate needed expressions</i> it has now changed to <i>Evaluate all expressions</i>, unless the user changes
            it. For most cases, this will be just fine, but there might be rare cases where this matters.
          </li>
          <li>The new action <i>Shut down task</i> executes an action when JMRI shuts down.</li>
          <li>The new LocoNet action <i>Set speed zero</i> sets the speed to zero for all the
          LocoNet slots.</li>
          <li>LogixNGs can now be inline in panels. Right-click on a icon on a panel and
          select <i>LogixNG -> Inline</i> to add a LogixNG to a icon on a panel. Inline
          LogixNGs can be viewed by menu item <i>Tools -> LogixNG -> Inline LogixNGs</i>.
          When a ConditionalNG is executed that's inline, two special local variables will
          be defined:
            <ul>
              <li>__InlineLogixNG__ : The name of the icon</li>
              <li>__Editor__ : The name of the editor of the icon</li>
              <li>Note that these two has two underlines at the beginning and end of the name.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Fixes a serious bug when deleting a LogixNG. Not all ConditionalNGs of
          that LogixNG was deleted but that's fixed now.</li>
          <li>Update the Global Variable table browser to provide detail information.</li>
          <li>LogixNG Formula now supports the boolean XOR operator <i>^^</i>.</li>
          <li>The ConditionalNG editor and the Module editor now have the option
          <i>Paste copy</i>. With it, you can paste from the clipboard as many times
          as needed.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Request update of all sensors</i> has been added. It requests
          that all sensors gets updated from the layout.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Create beans from table</i> has been added.</li>
          <li>The action <i>Find table row or column</i> has been added.</li>
          <li>Adds support of multiple types of CSV files to LogixNG Tables.
          Tab separated files are the default, but you may choose Comma
          as the separator. This allows you load CSV files created by
          spreadsheet programs.</li>
          <li>The expression <i>Power</i> now supports the <i>Idle</i> and <i>Unknown</i>
          states. Therefore the option <i>Other</i> has been renamed to <i>On or Off</i>.
          A Power expression that had the state <i>Other</i> now has the state <i>On or Off</i>,
          with <i>Is/IsNot</i> inverted.</li>
          <li>The expression <i>Power</i> can now ignore the <i>Unknown</i> state. Most
          power managers in JMRI sets the state to Unknown before changing the state. This might
          cause problems when using the expression Power with IfThenElse with ExecuteOnChange.</li>
          <li>Additional shortcut keys have been added to the ConditionalNG editor.
            <ul>
              <li>Ctrl + Shift + R: Remove socket</li>
              <li>Ctrl + Shift + D: Enable</li>
              <li>Ctrl + D: Disable</li>
              <li>For macOS, use Cmd instead of Ctrl.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Formula function <i>writeMemory</i> is added. It's in the <i>NamedBean</i> category.</li>
          <li>Fixes a bug that crashed the LogixNG debugger when debugging a ConditionalNG
          that calls LogixNG Modules.</li>
          <li>The Throttle action supports multiple throttle connections.</li>
          <li>The expression <i>Sensor Edge</i> has been added. It returns True when
          the sensor goes from one predefined state to another predefined state.</li>
          <li>The LogixNG table now have the option <i>Execute</i> that lets you to
          execute a single LogixNG.</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>Operations</h3>
        <a id="Operations" name="Operations"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced passenger blocking. Negative blocking numbers place passenger cars in front of
                freight cars.</li>
            <li>Added hazardous classification to car loads. Now a car can be classified as hazardous
                depending on the car's load.</li>
            <li>Improved car blocking when car is hazardous. The program will attempt to place
                non-hazardous cars in front of hazardous cars.</li>
            <li>New automation feature. Users can now select an automation to run at startup. See under
                Tools in the operations Automations window.</li>
            <li>Improved Manifest and switch list formating when using tabular and load set out and pick
                up messages.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Preferences</h3>
        <a id="Preferences" name="Preferences"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>Shutdown</strong> preference has been created to support the
            StoreAndCompare process that detects changes to PanelPro tables and panels.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
        <a id="Resources" name="Resources"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Purple on, off icons added to USS sensor directory.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scripting</h3>
        <a id="Scripting" name="Scripting"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>A new script GrandReset.py</a> has been added. The
            script deletes all Transits, Sections and SignalMastLogics.</li>
            <li>Updated ControlPanel.py sample script to show the panel windows
            instead of the panel editor windows.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Signaling</h3>
        <h4>Signal Heads</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>"Single Output" signal heads had their Thrown and Reversed
                positions
                <a href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers/message/210041">reversed in the "Add..." dialog</a>.
                This is now corrected.
                </li>
            </ul>

   <h3>Speedometer</h3>
        <a id="Speedometer" name="Speedometer"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Expanded user documentation</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Turnouts, Lights, Sensors and other elements</h3>
        <a id="TLae" name="TLae"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a spurious error message when creating some internal items.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Warrants</h3>
        <a id="Wt" name="Wt"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix bug making NXWarrants over very short blocks.</li>
            <li>New concatenation option (Warrant Table menu Warrants->Concatenate Warrants).
               Concatenated warrant may either stop or continue at speed through the connecting
               block. It is no longer required to match paths at the connecting block.
               Concatenation will find the connecting path if it exists.
               This method is preferred rather than linking warrants of the same DCC address.</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Web Server</h3>
        <a id="server" name="server"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Added Camera webThrottle to Web Server.<br>
                Camera webThrottle provides integrated support for controlling trains with integrated POV or overhead IP based cameras.<br>
                Throttle Learn More page has been added for the camera throttle that covers setup and connecting the cameras to the engine throttle.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <a id="Misc" name="Misc"></a>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Several of the PanelPro tables, such as Routes and Logix, display a reminder to store changes before quitting. There are a number of issues with this approach.
                <ul>
                    <li>Only some of the tables have the reminder.
                    <li>Panel changes don't have a reminder.
                    <li>The reminder does not occur when quitting, or if it does, it is too late.
                </ul>
                The JMRI 5.1.1 test release has a global store reminder when running PanelPro.
                DecoderPro is not affected. Any change that affects the stored layout data file will
                trigger a reminder with an option to do a store before the final shutdown.
                <p>
                The global store reminder process is controlled by a new Shutdown option in JMRI Preferences.
                This is located between Start Up and Display. There are a number of scenarios where the
                global store reminder is not appropriate, such as running PanelPro using automatic start up and shutdown.
                See Shutdown Preference for details.
                <p>
                What is considered a change that needs to be stored?
                The process creates a temporary stored file and compares it to the last loaded file.
                If they are different, a store notification will occur.
                The comparison is a line by line compare, not a logical content comparison.
                Listed below are some of the implications of the process.
                <ul>
                    <li>Running PanelPro without loading a layout data file,
                        such as running Operations, a WiThrottle server, etc.
                        Since there is no file to compare to, it is assumed that there might be additions that need to be stored.
                    <li>External events that make changes.
                        Examples are scripts that create new table entries,
                        new hardware that can generate table entries, such as adding a DS64 on LocoNet, etc.
                    <li>JMRI version changes. These can be significant, such as new features.
                        Or trivial because the sequence of rows are in a different order in the layout data file.
                        This last one affects layout data files from JMRI 4.26 that use signal heads and SSL.
                </ul>
                The compare process stops with the first occurrence of a potential change.
                The details of the compared lines are listed in the JMRI system console (Help => System Console).

            <li>Minor changes to resolve Spotbug OS_OPEN_STREAM_EXCEPTION_PATH </li>
            <li>Minor changes to resolve Spotbug ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD </li>
            <li>Reduce the verbosity of MDNS logging.</li>
            <li><i>jmri.jmrix.SystemConnectionMemoManager</i> has new utility methods to find a connection by its connection name.<br>
            <code>LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo memo = SystemConnectionMemoManager.getConnection("L2", LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo.class);</code><br>
            <code>LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo memo = SystemConnectionMemoManager.getConnectionByUserName("LocoNet", LocoNetSystemConnectionMemo.class);</code><br>
            <code>MqttSystemConnectionMemo memo = SystemConnectionMemoManager.getConnection("M", MqttSystemConnectionMemo.class);</code>
            <code>MqttSystemConnectionMemo memo = SystemConnectionMemoManager.getConnectionByUserName("MQTT", MqttSystemConnectionMemo.class);</code>
            </li>
            <li>The PlantUML library has been updated to the current version.  This is used for
                developer documentation.
            </li>
            <li>The French JMRI Help pages were updated for responsive display.<br>
              They will appear when using the French locale, or from their own
              <a href="https://www.jmri.org/index_fr.shtml">starting page</a>.</li>
            <li>SpotBugs has been updated to 4.7.2</li>

            <li>The local help stub file has been moved from the settings location to the home
            location.  This fixes a problem introduced by recent versions of Ubuntu and its
            derivatives.</li>
            <li>Updated File Chooser to enable directories to be selectable.</li>
           <li>SpotBugs has been updated to 4.7.3</li>
            <li>Remove the i18n-consistency-check ant target (and related jar) as ineffective</li>
        </ul>
